# Member Handbook

This handbook is your guide to the cultural norms of our community.

You'll learn our preferred ways to structure discussions, what channels we have and how we use them, a few points of etiquette, and some extra options for power users.

Note: This guide is currently a work-in-progress under active development (as of August 31st, 2020). Watch for nails!

## How We Slack

We treat Slack like a message board, not like a chat. Here's how that works.

When you want to start a discussion, act as though you're creating a forum post or blog post. Prepare what you want to say in its entirety, including any links, and then submit it all in a single message. In other words, please don't send multiple messages in succession. You can create newlines with `shift-enter`, but it's helpful to draft longer messages in your text editor of choice, and then paste them into Slack when you're ready to post.

When you want to respond to someone's post, always use threaded replies. On desktop, hover over the message and in the popover menu at the top right of the message choose "Reply to thread"; on mobile, simply tap any message to open the thread view.

Please try to keep thread replies on-topic with respect to the original post. If you want to fork a discussion off in a new direction — say, if you feel a tangent coming on — by all means start a new top-level post that includes a link back to whatever message sparked your digression.

When you post a message that includes links, those links will often generate rich previews that appear under your message. If you link to a video, the preview will allow the video to be watched right from the Slack. This is nice! But often, these previews don't add anything of substance, and they eat up a lot of scroll height. In this case, please delete these rich previews (which, AFAIK, can only be done using the Slack web or desktop clients, not the mobile app). Note that community moderators may remove these previews too if they aren't adding much value.

## Channels

Each of our channels has a specific purpose. Below, you'll find the descriptions of how we use each channel. When you're in the Slack, you can check the *pinned messages* in a channel to see the channel's description.

### #introduce-yourself
When you first join the community, please drop a post here. You can tell us about your background, what your interests are, how you got into computer futurism, how you found the Slack, interesting hobbies — anything that'll help us know where you're coming from. Feel free to share past project URLs, and tag other members you know.

Please, no links to startups, unless you also provide something deeply technical, philosophical, or otherwise interesting for us to talk about.

### #thinking-together
This is the primary channel for discussion. If you have big thoughts or questions about the future of computing, post them here.

While you can add reference links to your posts, please take any discussions that center around external links to the next channel...

### #linking-together
If you have an interesting link (or podcast, or book, or any other kind of external resource), this is the channel to discuss it.

Please keep this channel focused on links that are relevant to the future of computing, or reflections on the arc of history. For links about the present, they're better off in #present-company.

### #present-company
Have something cool to share that doesn't quite feel on-topic? Our random channel is a great place to enthuse about interesting things that are only distantly related, or perhaps not related at all, to the future of coding.

### #share-your-work
Share your own projects, blog posts, or detailed concepts. We'll give them constructive feedback.

### #two-minute-week
Once each week, post a 2-minute (max) video explaining your most recent progress on your project. [Learn More](/two-minute-week)

### #random-encounters
Every 4 weeks, @donut will randomly pair everyone in this channel for 1-on-1 conversations. It's a good way to get to know others in the Slack.

### #administrivia
Discuss ways to better collaborate, improve this Slack, or resolve community issues.

### #announcements
Post if you are hiring or looking for work. Work related to the future of coding is preferred but all paid opportunities are allowed. Don't post more than once every couple of months about yourself or your company.

There are a handful of other channels, focussed on meetups and subject-specific discussion. When you first arrive, be sure to check them out and join the ones that fit your interests.
